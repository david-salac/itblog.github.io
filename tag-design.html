        One of the typical challenges when doing export of numerical computations is how to include the way how you achieve the results. Typically if results should be in Excel sheet at the end, you want to see the computation formula if you click on each cell. There is a native way using some Excel driver (like XlsxWriter) available in Python, but if you are dealing with a big Excel sheet, it becomes quite inconvenient.

        One of the common challenges of on-demand large datasets processing is the time required for data processing. The naive approach is to compute the operations on the same unit that serves results (and horizontally scale the system when it is overloaded). The more complex (and generally speaking the only right) approach is to use some asynchronous task queue based on distributed message passing (message broker).

        Code profiling is one of the most important parts of the code optimisation process. Generally speaking, it is the program analysis where we are mainly interested in memory usage and time complexity of the program (or each of its part). We can also be interested in how often we use some function (or how often we call it, what's the duration). There are a lot of principles and tools to perform these tasks.

        One of the everyday challenges in back-end development is how to design and develop a secure gateway. The correctly designed gateway should handle each requirement quickly but concerning security. The security requirement is especially essential concerning the new laws related to GDPR in EU and increasing number of hacking attempts (often successful) to services.

        Currently, the most popular public-key cryptosystem is still RSA. It is despite the fact that more sophisticated and secure systems are available (including quantum resistant ones). It is probably due to the relative simplicity of the algorithm, long history and available technical support. On the other hand, considering advancement in quantum computers development as well as in programmable hardware, the security of this cryptosystem is becoming more and more questionable.

        During the last few years, we could see a revolution if it comes to entering passwords to online services (e-shops, email providers, social networks etc.). This revolution ensued in a surge of the forgotten passwords. More and more users forget password just after entering it. This leads to an increasing number of the toolkits for storing passwords where each has its own vulnerabilities.

        The Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC provides new possibilities for increase of efficiency of cryptanalysis methods for public–key systems such as RSA or Diffie–Hellman key exchange algorithm. These cryptosystems are based on the discrete logarithm and integer factorization problem. After brief introduction to numerical methods for solving of these problems there is an introduction to the distributed system that aims to solving of these problems.
