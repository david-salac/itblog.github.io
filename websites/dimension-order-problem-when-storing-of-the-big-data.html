        One of the common challenges when dealing with big multidimensional data sets is how to store them. There are many problems to deal with, but arguably the most important one is what dimension order to choose. Although typically the selection of the optimal dimensional order does not have any impact on the size of the output file (if you use some compression situation may differ), it has a profound effect on the response time when accessing stored data.

<h2>What is the optimal rule to follow when choosing the dimension order?</h2>
<p>Luckily in many cases, there is the simple rule to follow. First of all, you need to know how does your typical selecting (or writing) request look like. There are a few things to consider:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Do you often select just one point most of the time?</li>
    <li>Do you often select the series of data only at one dimension?</li>
    <li>Do you follow some pattern when selecting data in more than one dimension?</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally, the first case is the best one when it almost does not matter what dimension order do you choose. More precisely, the most convenient thing is to select the dimension order that is equivalent to the order of data to be written - it makes writing fast and does not affect the reading.</p>
<p>The second case is the most common one. Typically it is equivalent to selecting time series of a point data (one dimension varies, others are on some fixed value). In this case, there is a simple rule: keep the varying dimension as the last one when writing data. The rationale for this choice is simple. Data that are stored (say on the hard drive) are stored as a one dimensional series of bytes. So technically when you are selecting, you choose just the right slice of this one dimension of data. If your most varying dimension is on the wrong position, you must skip some chunk of data when reading and then artificially reconstruct the series from these broken pieces (both makes the process slow).</p>
<p>The third case is the most problematic one. There is only one rule to follow: keep dimensions in order from the least varying to the most varying dimension. There are as well many special cases when even this rule is not the best one to follow (see use case bellow).</p>

<h2>How are data stored technically?</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, data are technically stored in just one dimension. This raises the question of how is it possible to store multidimensional data to just one dimension and them reconstruct them? The answer is simpler than one might think. Suppose you have just three dimensions of sizes (<em>l</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>l</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>l</em><sub>3</sub>). Then each point <em>P</em> has coordinates (<em>p</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>p</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>p</em><sub>3</sub>) - always indexed from 0 to <em>l</em><sub>i</sub> (right excluded). You can easily map these three coordinates to just one coordinate, say <em>q</em> by using the relation:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
    <em>q</em> = <em>p</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>l</em><sub>1</sub> &#8901; <em>p</em><sub>2</sub> + <em>l</em><sub>1</sub> &#8901; <em>l</em><sub>2</sub> &#8901; <em>p</em><sub>3</sub>
</p>
<p>draw a cube and try it practically, if you do not believe. And a similar relation is usable for the inverse mapping (from one dimension to three dimensions):</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
    <em>p</em><sub>3</sub> = FLOOR(<em>q</em> / (<em>l</em><sub>1</sub> &#8901; <em>l</em><sub>2</sub>))<br>
    <em>p</em><sub>2</sub> = FLOOR((<em>q</em> - <em>p</em><sub>3</sub> &#8901; <em>l</em><sub>1</sub> &#8901; <em>l</em><sub>2</sub>) / <em>l</em><sub>1</sub>)<br>
    <em>p</em><sub>1</sub> = <em>q</em> - <em>p</em><sub>3</sub> &#8901; <em>l</em><sub>1</sub> &#8901; <em>l</em><sub>2</sub> - <em>p</em><sub>2</sub> &#8901; <em>l</em><sub>1</sub>
</p>
<p>where FLOOR is the floor function (take just integer part, ignore the decimal one).</p>
<p>The same logic can be used for any number of dimensions. Although it can be quite problematic that for more than three dimensions, there is no simple way how to imagine that problem geometrically.</p>
<h2>Use case</h2>
<p>The typical problem that one can imagine is the time series of some map. Say that you want to monitor irradiance at some location from the satellite. In each time step, you have a 2D map of irradiance (the third dimension is time itself). So the dimensions are longitude, latitude and time. These maps are practically crucial for prediction of the solar panels productions.</p>
<p>The following request for selecting data are the most common ones:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Select the time series of irradiance at some geographical location (in order to analyse some average values, peaks, etc.).</li>
    <li>Select some polygon on the map and compute the average irradiance in each time-step (and return just 1D time series of this average values). This step is crucial when building large solar installations (you do not have just one point).</li>
</ol>
<p>The first problem is the simple one; the best approach is to have a time dimension in the last place.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the second use case is quite problematic. The optimal dimension order has to be determined by the average size of polygons. If your polygons are big enough, having a time series in the first place is the best option (and having in the last place is the worst one). This is due to the computation that is performed at each time step. If you have a big polygon and time dimension in the first place, you can very swiftly compute the average value at each time step. If the time dimension is on the last place, you must read each column (in geometric representation) separately which is slow.</p>
<h2>Writing issue</h2>
<p>It is good to know that if your data are coming in some specific dimension order, it is not that trivial to store them in a different order. It is always important to be aware of the trade-off between fast reading and fast writing. So if you write data just for archive (and do not expect frequent processing), it is handier to write them as they are not to permutate any dimensions. The problem of dimension permutation is even more challenging if you write a massive amount of data (that cannot be stored in operational memory). In this case, the chunking of data should take place. Generally, there is no simple manual for dealing with this issue - you have to use your common sense.</p>
<h2>Remarks and summary</h2>
<p>If you are lucky enough and have some simple problem that fits the categories mentioned above, you can achieve a significant performance overhaul just by swapping dimension order of your data. In many cases, unfortunately, there is no simple solution. You may often need more than one source of data when you aim to optimise performance (each having different dimension order). The trade-off between writing data in different dimension order (which is slow) and reading them also has to be taken into account. Do not feel afraid to use your common sense when dealing with this issue as there is generally no precise manual for your problem.</p>
