        <p class="lead">One of the common challenges when dealing with data is how to send the dataset from one place to another and how to store data effectively. These problems are interconnected, as they both require serialization of data (sometimes called data encoding). Generally, the most effective data serialization method is to transform (or rather keep) data structures in binary form (opposite to text formats like JSON or XML). As usual, there are many established ways and standards for dealing with this issue.</p>

<h2>What are serialization and deserialization?</h2>
<p>Serialization (aka encoding) is when an object in your code is transformed to a format suitable for saving to storage or transfer over a network. The object here can be everything (class instance, any variable, class/type definition itself, etc.). The opposite process is called deserialization (aka decoding). Generally, there are two ways for serializing data: binary and text.</p> 

<p>Serialization into a text format means that data are transformed into a human-readable sequence of characters. The most common (and standardized) ways for serializing data are CSV, XML and JSON. Mainly JSON is a popular choice - as data sets are relatively small and processable in JavaScript - which is vital in the world of REST services. Also, many tools are available for transforming data from one text format into another (or a different form of the same). Moreover, popular Unix tools (like grep, awk) can help you process data in a text format. The main disadvantages of text format are the output size and slow, plus often unprecise, (de)serialization process. However, the most significant advantage is that the result is easily readable and editable (using a text editor).</p>

<p>On the other hand, binary serialization is fast and effective (if it comes to output size). In the simplest form, the concrete binary representation of the object located in memory is transformed into a series of bytes. Moreover, it is a quick and exact process - as you can deserialize the same sequence of bites back in the same way. Naturally, there are more complex ways to serialize objects than just taking memory snap-shots, but the logic is always alike. The disadvantages of binary serialization are no simple way for editing results or even reading them in any simple editor.</p>

<p>Regarding the precision of the process, consider, for example, the IEE-754 double-precision float. The size based on the standard is 64 bites (8 bytes) - this is always true; it does not matter what number you choose. So if you serialize to binary representation, the result has always these eight bites - it also can be precisely deserialized. However, if you serialize the same number to text, it can be just one byte, but also (depending on precision) 16 bytes or more - plus deserialization does not always give you the same number.</p>

<h2>Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and RPC frameworks</h2>
<p>The issue that is closely related to binary data serialization is RPC. Technically, there are three main ways to get data from a remote source: REST, RPC, and message passing. REST (combined with JSON) is a standard in web development - it uses text serialization, all transfer data can usually be easily decoded and modified, same holds for requests. However, as mentioned above, this is not optimal when the volume of data and process speed matter, mainly in applications where minimal latency is essential. Therefore, there are RPC frameworks for applications where the speed of the data transfer matters. Note that many RPC frameworks do not use binary serialization (or at least support options for using text serialization instead), but these are not the subject here.</p>

<p>Syntax of RPC request in programming language usually really resembles calling of function (hence the name procedure call). However, all input parameters are serialized and transferred over the network. Also, the response is serialized and transferred back. The usual use cases for RPC frameworks are communication between services (microservices), interaction with embedded devices (like sensors) or similar dedicated applications. Unfortunately, most RPC frameworks are not fully supported in browsers, so they cannot replace REST.</p>

<h2>Technical possibilities</h2>
<p>As described above, RPC and binary serialization are intertwined problems. However, some frameworks are mainly ready to act as RPC frameworks (like gRPC or Thrift), others as primary tools for binary serialization (like Apache Avro). Each technology that follows is prevalent for these purposes (and follows good practices - meaning that it is free and open-source).</p>

<h3>gRPC framework</h3>
<p>Google published this technology in 2016, and it has quickly become prevalent. As a result, practically all popular programming languages support gRPC (like C#, C++, Java, Python, Go). The framework uses so-called Protocol Buffers to define communication protocol. Protocol Buffers are essential for describing the interface - what each procedure accepts and returns, specifying data types including arrays, etc. This concept is called interface definition language (IDL). A special script then generates files for the programming language - technically, these files present a static library defining RPC procedures (as functions) and data types. Both client and server use these (libraries) files - although differently.</p>

<p>To demonstrate how our gRPC works, there is a simple example. Suppose we want to list all items in a shopping trolley and return some overall statistics (like the total price and number of things). But as a first thing, we need to install gRPC - this example uses Python programming language, you can install gRPC using PIP (as <code>pip install grpcio grpcio-tools</code>).</p>

<p>Protocol Buffer file (with name <code>trolley.proto</code>) for our example can have the following syntax:</p>

<pre class="code"><code>syntax = "proto3";

message Item {
  string name = 1;
  double unit_price = 2;
  int32 count = 3;
}

message TrolleyContent {
  repeated Item content = 1;
  int32 total_count = 2;
  double total_price = 3;
}

message User {
  string name = 1;
  string UUID = 2;
}

service Trolley {
  rpc GetContent(User) returns (TrolleyContent) {}
}
</code></pre>

<p>To generate static (libraries) files, run the command:</p>

<pre class="code"><code>python -m grpc_tools.protoc --proto_path=. \
    trolley.proto --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=.</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the script generates two files (libraries):</p> 

<pre class="code"><code>trolley_pb2.py
trolley_pb2_grpc.py</code></pre>

<p>These are two files that are used as an interface in your Python application. However, there is already one problem, the relative import at the beginning of the trolley_pb2_grpc script:</p>

<pre class="code"><code>import trolley_pb2 as trolley__pb2</code></pre>

<p>You must manually replace this line with the correct path inside your project. It is inconvenient that the script for a generation does not set up the relative or absolute project path. However, that is the reality you can easily circumvent.</p>

<p>If we continue with our example, we need to write a server that handles requests. As mentioned above, we want to use Python everywhere (for both client and server) - but you can find many tutorials for other programming languages. Unfortunately, there is no complex service framework for RPC like Django (that works for REST), so you need to write things from a low level. The following example shows a simple server:</p>

<pre class="code"><code>import traceback
from concurrent import futures
import logging

import trolley_pb2 as trolley_pb2
import trolley_pb2_grpc as trolley_pb2_grpc


LOGGER = logging.getLogger("gRPC server")
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

    def GetContent(self, request, context):

            valid_uuids = SELECT_FROM_DB

def serve():
    """Main application loop"""
    server = grpc.server(
        futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4)
    )

        Trolley(), server

<p>As you can see, the most important part of the server is the extension of TrolleyServicer. Servicer classes are related to a particular service (interface), and the logic of the server is implemented in their extension. The class that inherits from Servicer has to override all methods (RPC procedures). It is also essential to add some standard error handling (and understand return codes). The function <code>serve</code> is the server main loop - instantiates server on a particular address and port.</p> 

<p>Now, let's move to the client-side. Consider the following example that sends a request and print incoming results. It also contains some fundamental error handling on the client-side.</p>

<pre class="code"><code>import grpc
import trolley_pb2_grpc
import trolley_pb2


# Open gRPC channel
with grpc.insecure_channel(
    # Address of gRPC server
    f'localhost:{GRPC_PORT}'
) as channel:
    # Create gRPC Stub
    stub = trolley_pb2_grpc.TrolleyStub(channel)
    # Get content
    content = stub.GetContent(
        trolley_pb2.User(name="John",
                         UUID=EXISTING_UUID)
    )
    # Process response:
    print(f"Count: {content.total_count} \n"
          f"Price: {content.total_price}")
    for item in content.content:
        print(f"Name: {item.name} \n"
              f"Unit price: {item.unit_price} \n"
              f"Count: {item.count}")

    # Now let's handle error request
    try:
        content = stub.GetContent(
            trolley_pb2.User(name="Peter",
                             UUID=WRONG_UUID)
        )
    except grpc.RpcError as e:
        if e.code() == grpc.StatusCode.INVALID_ARGUMENT:
            print("Special handling for the code")
        print(f"error when processing request: {e.details()}")</code></pre>

<p>The most important entity is the stub (the client-side equivalent of a servicer). First, the client has to instantiate stubs with the channel directly (it is a parameter of the constructor). Then there is a part that uses stub for sending requests to the server.<</p>

<p>When you instantiate stub, the important thing to notice is that no connection is immediately created. That is done later when the concrete procedure is called. Another thing that is good to bear in mind is the retry policy - there is no default retry policy configured. You have to do this manually (read the documentation to see more) - and it is important to do so.</p>

<p>Working with gRPC is often challenging. For example, the automatic reboot of a server (when anything changes) is not supported. This is inconvenient because you need to restart the server manually when anything changes. Also, many helpful tools like Postman are not available. There is, however, a command-line equivalent of curl (called grpcurl) - that can help a lot when debugging.</p>

<p>There are ways for using gRPC to serialize data directly to a disk - the logic of gRPC proto buffers is the same. However, as the name suggests, gRPC is mainly the RPC framework. It is most widespread if it comes to communication between services.</p>

<h3>Apache Thrift</h3>

<p>Facebook developed Thrift in 2008; it became an open-source project in 2010 (known as Apache Thrift). It is a quite popular framework - technically, it is the equivalent of gRPC. It is up to every developer team to choose their preferred RPC framework.</p>

<p>Thrift's interface definition language and RPC protocol are both called Apache Thrift (technically equivalent gRPC and protocol buffer). Thrift allows using additional configuration options (like nonbinary communication using text serialization), making it a bit more complex in some ways than gRPC. But generally, what is true about gRPC is also true about Thrift.</p>

<p>Regarding the example described above, the interface definition would look like this (file <code>trolley.thrift</code>):</p>

<pre class="code"><code>struct Item {
  1: string name,
  2: double unit_price,
  3: i32 count
}

struct TrolleyContent {
  1: list<Item> content,
  2: i32 total_count,
  3: double total_price
}

struct User {
  1: string name,
  2: string UUID
}

service Trolley {
  TrolleyContent GetContent(1: User user)
}</code></pre>

<p>You can immediately see many similarities with the protocol buffer file. However, this structure is slightly more complex (including possibilities to return arrays in services).</p>

<p>To generate library files, use the command:</p>

<pre class="code"><code>thrift -r --gen py trolley.thrift</code></pre>

<p>If we continue with our example, the code on the server-side will look like this:</p>

<pre class="code"><code>import logging
import sys
# Add path to generated script
sys.path.append('gen-py')

from trolley import Trolley
from trolley.ttypes import Item, TrolleyContent, User

from thrift.transport import TSocket
from thrift.transport import TTransport
from thrift.protocol import TBinaryProtocol
from thrift.server import TServer
from thrift.Thrift import TException

LOGGER = logging.getLogger(__file__)

    def GetContent(self, user: User) -> TrolleyContent:
        # 1. Do some validation of inputs
        valid_uuids = SELECT_FROM_DB
        if user.UUID not in valid_uuids:
            # Prepare error message (if relevant)
            raise TException("Wrong UUID")

        # 2. Prepare response
        response = TrolleyContent(
            total_count=3,
            total_price=57.5,
            content=[
                # List of Thrift messages
                Item(name="Blue car",
                     unit_price=3.50,
                     count=6),
                Item(name="Red car",
                     unit_price=12.0,
                     count=2),

                     unit_price=12.5,

        )

def serve():
    handler = TrolleyHandler()
    processor = Trolley.Processor(handler)
    transport = TSocket.TServerSocket(host=THRIFT_HOST,
                                      port=THRIFT_PORT)
    tfactory = TTransport.TBufferedTransportFactory()
    pfactory = TBinaryProtocol.TBinaryProtocolFactory()

    server = TServer.TSimpleServer(
        processor, transport, tfactory, pfactory
    )

    # You could do one of these for a multithreaded server
    # server = TServer.TThreadedServer(

    server.serve()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Start server
    LOGGER.info('Starting the server')
    serve()
    LOGGER.info('done')</code></pre>

<p>Again, even here, the resemblance to gRPC is considerable. The main server-class overrides all implemented methods (services) defined in the Thrift file. The handling of data types is more natural (as types behave like real classes). Handling error is more straightforward - you can raise something inherited from TException and catch it on the client-side.</p>

<p>Client example:</p>

<pre class="code"><code>import sys
sys.path.append('gen-py')

from trolley import Trolley
from trolley.ttypes import Item, TrolleyContent, User

from thrift.Thrift import TException
from thrift.transport import TSocket
from thrift.transport import TTransport
from thrift.protocol import TBinaryProtocol


def main():
    # Make socket
    transport = TSocket.TSocket(THRIFT_HOST, THRIFT_PORT)
    # Buffering is critical. Raw sockets are very slow
    transport = TTransport.TBufferedTransport(transport)
    # Wrap in a protocol
    protocol = TBinaryProtocol.TBinaryProtocol(transport)
    # Create a client to use the protocol encoder
    client = Trolley.Client(protocol)
    # Connect!
    transport.open()

    # Call request (with context)
    user = User(name="Some real user",
                UUID=EXISTING_UUID)
    trolley_content: TrolleyContent = client.GetContent(user)
    # Process response
    print(f"Count: {trolley_content.total_count} \n"
          f"Price: {trolley_content.total_price}")
    for item in trolley_content.content:
        print(f"Name: {item.name}"
              f"Unit price: {item.unit_price}",
              f"Count: {item.count}")
    # Error handling:
    try:
        user = User(name="Some nonexisting user",
                    UUID=WRONG_UUID)
        client.GetContent(user)
    except TException as e:
        print(e)

    # Close!
    transport.close()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Call client
    main()</code></pre>

<p>Client code is again very similar to gRPC client; creating connection is more complex (3 lines more), but the rest is almost the same. In addition, error handling is more straightforward.</p>

<p>Similarly, as gRPC, Apache Thrift can be used to serialize data to disk. As is mentioned above, you can easily find ready-made examples of how to do it. However, the principle is the same (you still need to define data structures in Thrift's interface definition language).</p> 

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>One of the common challenges when storing or sending data on the network is effectively serializing them (converting them into technically suitable representation). Binary serialization is one of the essential parts of most Remote Procedure Call (RPC) frameworks. The most popular RPC frameworks are gRPC and Apache Thrift. The principle of interface definition language is to describe interface (methods and data types that the subject of transfer). The IDL of gRPC is called protocol buffers. Apache Thrift uses IDL with the same name (Thrift file). There are, of course, many other similar technologies - like Apache Avro, designed for specific purposes (and extended to support RPC).</p>
