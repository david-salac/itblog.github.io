        One of the common challenges when dealing with data is how to send the dataset from one place to another and how to store data effectively. These problems are interconnected, as they both require serialization of data (sometimes called data encoding). Generally, the most effective data serialization method is to transform (or rather keep) data structures in binary form (opposite to text formats like JSON or XML). As usual, there are many established ways and standards for dealing with this issue.

        It is more than ordinary that organizations that work with big data have two absolutely separated teams - one team responsible for processing data (data scientists) and another for writing and designing applications for end-users (that formally should use that data). It is equally common that problems of people in one universe are incomprehensible to people in another one. Not very surprisingly, the split leads to many problems.

        This article presents some most popular use-cases and technologies related to NoSQL databases. These types of databases have become more and more popular. Furthermore, each presented technology provides some advantages for the specific use case (for example, graph databases can help effectively select objects based on relations constraints). Therefore, it is becoming essential to know these technologies and be capable of using them.

        Multitasking and multiprocessing are the two main components of parallel programming. There is native support for these features in Python (CPython). But there are some limits specific to Python that has to be taken into an account. The main problem is called GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) - which significantly reduces the number of use cases for applications in Python (mainly for creating asynchronous pipelines).

        This article is focused on the design and implementation details of the system for the prediction of renewable energy. I am talking here about the web application (not about the desktop app). Some helpful information from the project management perspective is also mentioned (including costs of the project). This article can be helpful for you to decide if you want to choose this path and to save your time.

        Cache represents a way how you can make your algorithm (whatever it is) work faster. Basically, it stores some outputs of your algorithm for some specific inputs (based on its policy) and when you ask your algorithm for something, it first checks if that information is stored in a memory (cache) so it can return it without performing any computations. If this logic succeeds (information is in memory) it is called a cache hit.

        There are many helpful things in Python that are important for effective development. Some of them are less known; some of them are a way more popular. This article presents class methods and static methods (in a Python way), conversion from class to dictionary (and vice versa) and metaclasses and their applications. This article might be helpful for beginners in Python to improve their skills.
