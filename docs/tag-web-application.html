        This article is focused on the design and implementation details of the system for the prediction of renewable energy. I am talking here about the web application (not about the desktop app). Some helpful information from the project management perspective is also mentioned (including costs of the project). This article can be helpful for you to decide if you want to choose this path and to save your time.

        One of the traditional arguments on why to avoid using ORM is the lack of performance. Although it is generally speaking correct, there are many ways how to write queries in your application. Some of them are better than others. There is almost always a way to significantly increase the performance of an application without avoiding the ORM approach. We anticipate some preliminary knowledge of Django and SQL here (so make sure you understand basic concepts before continuing).

        How to effectively generate a static website is a common problem that each developer has to solve at some point. Static websites can be helpful for many purposes like for web composed of a few static pages, documentation or either a complex blog with tags and many articles. The most commons reasons why to prefer static website are security, cheap infrastructure, and fast deployment. But what are the suitable tools in Python for this purpose?

        There are many common challenges related to systems that process large data sets (like big netCDF or GRIB files). One of the most important decision is whether to deploy infrastructure on some cloud service or if it is better to use an on-premises solution. If the cloud appeals to you then other challenges arise, which provider would be the best one, how to deploy - use infrastructure as a code.

        One of the everyday challenges in back-end development is how to design and develop a secure gateway. The correctly designed gateway should handle each requirement quickly but concerning security. The security requirement is especially essential concerning the new laws related to GDPR in EU and increasing number of hacking attempts (often successful) to services.

        Currently, the most popular public-key cryptosystem is still RSA. It is despite the fact that more sophisticated and secure systems are available (including quantum resistant ones). It is probably due to the relative simplicity of the algorithm, long history and available technical support. On the other hand, considering advancement in quantum computers development as well as in programmable hardware, the security of this cryptosystem is becoming more and more questionable.

        During the last few years, we could see a revolution if it comes to entering passwords to online services (e-shops, email providers, social networks etc.). This revolution ensued in a surge of the forgotten passwords. More and more users forget password just after entering it. This leads to an increasing number of the toolkits for storing passwords where each has its own vulnerabilities.
