        Cache represents a way how you can make your algorithm (whatever it is) work faster. Basically, it stores some outputs of your algorithm for some specific inputs (based on its policy) and when you ask your algorithm for something, it first checks if that information is stored in a memory (cache) so it can return it without performing any computations. If this logic succeeds (information is in memory) it is called a cache hit. On the other hand, if the information is not in memory, it is called a cache miss.

        There are many helpful things in Python that are important for effective development. Some of them are less known; some of them are a way more popular. This article presents class methods and static methods (in a Python way), conversion from class to dictionary (and vice versa) and metaclasses and their applications. This article might be helpful for beginners in Python to improve their skills.

        One of the traditional arguments on why to avoid using ORM is the lack of performance. Although it is generally speaking correct, there are many ways how to write queries in your application. Some of them are better than others. There is almost always the way how to significantly increase the performance of application without avoiding the ORM approach.

        How to effectively generate a static website is a common problem that each developer has to solve at some point. Static websites can be helpful for many purposes like for web composed of a few static pages, documentation or either a complex blog with tags and many articles. The most commons reasons why to prefer static website are security, cheap infrastructure, and fast deployment. But what are the suitable tools in Python for this purpose?

        There are many tools in Python for creating and managing virtual environments. This article tends to analyze native virtual environment (created using venv command). Another simplified and more user-friendly approach is to use Anaconda software (using command conda).

        If one chooses to do a software developer, he will sooner or later find out that there is a lot of need-to-know things. Among them are the commands of the bash shell (and the shell itself). It can save you a lot of time in the future if you learn them now. This post presents the most commonly used commands and use-cases for them. They are helpful not only for software developers but to everyone who works in IT.
