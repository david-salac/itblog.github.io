        How to effectively generate a static website is a common problem that each developer has to solve at some point. Static websites can be helpful for many purposes like for web composed of a few static pages, documentation or either a complex blog with tags and many articles. The most commons reasons why to prefer static website are security, cheap infrastructure, and fast deployment. But what are the suitable tools in Python for this purpose?

        One of the typical challenges when doing the export of numerical computations is how to include the way your computations were achieved. Typically, if results should be in an Excel sheet in the end, you want to see a computation formula if you click on each cell. There is a native method - using some Excel driver (like XlsxWriter) available in Python.

        You cannot avoid it whenever you decide to manage some project in IT. What is the most effective way for organizing the work of your team? Probably none of the issues in project management is covered by so many posts, videos on YouTube, articles in scientific journals as this one. This article is about one concrete human perspective on project organization. It can help you to decide how to run your project.

        One of the common challenges of on-demand large datasets processing is the time required for data processing. The naive approach is to compute the operations on the same unit that serves results (and horizontally scale the system when it is overloaded). The more complex (and generally speaking the only right) approach is to use some asynchronous task queue based on distributed message passing (message broker).

        Code profiling is one of the most important parts of the code optimisation process. Generally speaking, it is the program analysis where we are mainly interested in memory usage and time complexity of the program (or each of its part). We can also be interested in how often we use some function (or how often we call it, what's the duration). There are a lot of principles and tools to perform these tasks.

        There are many common challenges related to systems that process large data sets (like big netCDF or GRIB files). One of the most important decision is whether to deploy infrastructure on some cloud service or if it is better to use an on-premises solution. If the cloud appeals to you then other challenges arise, which provider would be the best one, how to deploy - use infrastructure as a code.

        One of the everyday challenges in back-end development is how to design and develop a secure gateway. The correctly designed gateway should handle each requirement quickly but concerning security. The security requirement is especially essential concerning the new laws related to GDPR in EU and increasing number of hacking attempts (often successful) to services.
