        One of the common challenges of on-demand large datasets processing is the time required for data processing. The naive approach is to compute the operations on the same unit that serves results (and horizontally scale the system when it is overloaded). The more complex (and generally speaking the only right) approach is to use some asynchronous task queue based on distributed message passing (message broker).

        Code profiling is one of the most important parts of the code optimisation process. Generally speaking, it is the program analysis where we are mainly interested in memory usage and time complexity of the program (or each of its part). We can also be interested in how often we use some function (or how often we call it, what's the duration). There are a lot of principles and tools to perform these tasks.

        Famous library xarray is more or less standard in the data analyst branch. During the last few years, it has become incredibly popular. It has been deployed in many projects often without any careful decision if it is needed or if there is any other way how to treat the issue. One of the essential xarray functionality is the reading and writing to the NetCDF files. This is also a focus of this article.

        One of the everyday challenges in back-end development is how to design and develop a secure gateway. The correctly designed gateway should handle each requirement quickly but concerning security. The security requirement is especially essential concerning the new laws related to GDPR in EU and increasing number of hacking attempts (often successful) to services.

        One of the common challenges in data processing is to provide quick access to constants (or map of constants) stored in tables. This structure is typically useful to store multidimensional look-up tables (LUT). One of the most user-friendly (or rather programmer-friendly) ways how to store multidimensional (generally 2D) objects in Python is to use Pandas library and DataFrames objects.

        Currently, the most popular public-key cryptosystem is still RSA. It is despite the fact that more sophisticated and secure systems are available (including quantum resistant ones). It is probably due to the relative simplicity of the algorithm, long history and available technical support. On the other hand, considering advancement in quantum computers development as well as in programmable hardware, the security of this cryptosystem is becoming more and more questionable.

        During the last few years, we could see a revolution if it comes to entering passwords to online services (e-shops, email providers, social networks etc.). This revolution ensued in a surge of the forgotten passwords. More and more users forget password just after entering it. This leads to an increasing number of the toolkits for storing passwords where each has its own vulnerabilities.
