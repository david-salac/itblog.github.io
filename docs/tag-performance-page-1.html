        The optimal stopping is one of the most important topics in pure (theoretic) mathematics if it comes to real-life applications. It gives you an optimal pattern of how to approach many situations. It includes things like hiring a new employee, renting a flat, selling a house, finding your next love or just searching for a parking place. Despite the horrendous name, the logic is simple.

        One of the traditional arguments on why to avoid using ORM is the lack of performance. Although it is generally speaking correct, there are many ways how to write queries in your application. Some of them are better than others. There is almost always a way to significantly increase the performance of an application without avoiding the ORM approach. We anticipate some preliminary knowledge of Django and SQL here (so make sure you understand basic concepts before continuing).

        One of the common challenges when dealing with big multidimensional data sets is how to store them. There are many problems to deal with, but arguably the most important one is choosing dimension. Although typically, the selection of the optimal dimensional order does not impact the size of the output file (if you use some compression situation that may differ), it has a profound effect on the response time when accessing stored data.

        Virtual environments are an incredibly helpful concept that makes your coding much easier. There are many tools in Python for creating and managing virtual environments. This article tends to analyze the native virtual environment (created using the venv command). Another simplified and more user-friendly approach is to use Anaconda software (using command conda).

        You cannot avoid it whenever you decide to manage some project in IT. What is the most effective way for organizing the work of your team? Probably none of the issues in project management is covered by so many posts, videos on YouTube, articles in scientific journals as this one. This article is about one concrete human perspective on project organization. It can help you to decide how to run your project.

        One of the common challenges of on-demand large datasets processing is the time required for data processing. The naive approach is to compute the operations on the same unit that serves results (and horizontally scale the system when it is overloaded). The more complex (and generally speaking the only right) approach is to use some asynchronous task queue based on distributed message passing (message broker).

        Code profiling is one of the most important parts of the code optimisation process. Generally speaking, it is the program analysis where we are mainly interested in memory usage and time complexity of the program (or each of its part). We can also be interested in how often we use some function (or how often we call it, what's the duration). There are a lot of principles and tools to perform these tasks.
