        Cache represents a way how you can make your algorithm (whatever it is) work faster. Basically, it stores some outputs of your algorithm for some specific inputs (based on its policy) and when you ask your algorithm for something, it first checks if that information is stored in a memory (cache) so it can return it without performing any computations. If this logic succeeds (information is in memory) it is called a cache hit. On the other hand, if the information is not in memory, it is called a cache miss.

        There are many helpful things in Python that are important for effective development. Some of them are less known; some of them are a way more popular. This article presents class methods and static methods (in a Python way), conversion from class to dictionary (and vice versa) and metaclasses and their applications. This article might be helpful for beginners in Python to improve their skills.

        One of the traditional arguments on why to avoid using ORM is the lack of performance. Although it is generally speaking correct, there are many ways how to write queries in your application. Some of them are better than others. There is almost always the way how to significantly increase the performance of application without avoiding the ORM approach.

        How to effectively generate a static website is a common problem that each developer has to solve at some point. Static websites can be helpful for many purposes like for web composed of a few static pages, documentation or either a complex blog with tags and many articles. The most commons reasons why to prefer static website are security, cheap infrastructure, and fast deployment. But what are the suitable tools in Python for this purpose?

        One of the typical challenges when doing export of numerical computations is how to include the way how you achieve the results. Typically if results should be in Excel sheet at the end, you want to see the computation formula if you click on each cell. There is a native way using some Excel driver (like XlsxWriter) available in Python, but if you are dealing with a big Excel sheet, it becomes quite inconvenient.

        One of the common challenges of on-demand large datasets processing is the time required for data processing. The naive approach is to compute the operations on the same unit that serves results (and horizontally scale the system when it is overloaded). The more complex (and generally speaking the only right) approach is to use some asynchronous task queue based on distributed message passing (message broker).

        Code profiling is one of the most important parts of the code optimisation process. Generally speaking, it is the program analysis where we are mainly interested in memory usage and time complexity of the program (or each of its part). We can also be interested in how often we use some function (or how often we call it, what's the duration). There are a lot of principles and tools to perform these tasks.
