        This article is focused on the design and implementation details of the system for the prediction of renewable energy. I am talking here about the web application (not about the desktop app). Some helpful information from the project management perspective is also mentioned (including costs of the project). This article can be helpful for you to decide if you want to choose this path and if you decide to do so to save you a time.

        Cache represents a way how you can make your algorithm (whatever it is) work faster. Basically, it stores some outputs of your algorithm for some specific inputs (based on its policy) and when you ask your algorithm for something, it first checks if that information is stored in a memory (cache) so it can return it without performing any computations. If this logic succeeds (information is in memory) it is called a cache hit.

        There are many helpful things in Python that are important for effective development. Some of them are less known; some of them are a way more popular. This article presents class methods and static methods (in a Python way), conversion from class to dictionary (and vice versa) and metaclasses and their applications. This article might be helpful for beginners in Python to improve their skills.

        The optimal stopping is one of the most important topics in pure (theoretic) mathematics if it comes to real-life applications. It gives you an optimal pattern of how to approach many situations. It includes things like hiring a new employee, renting a flat, selling a house, finding your next love or just searching for a parking place. Despite the horrendous name, the logic is simple.

        One of the traditional arguments on why to avoid using ORM is the lack of performance. Although it is generally speaking correct, there are many ways how to write queries in your application. Some of them are better than others. There is almost always the way how to significantly increase the performance of application without avoiding the ORM approach.

        How to effectively generate a static website is a common problem that each developer has to solve at some point. Static websites can be helpful for many purposes like for web composed of a few static pages, documentation or either a complex blog with tags and many articles. The most commons reasons why to prefer static website are security, cheap infrastructure, and fast deployment. But what are the suitable tools in Python for this purpose?

        One of the typical challenges when doing the export of numerical computations is how to include the way your computations were achieved. Typically, if results should be in an Excel sheet in the end, you want to see a computation formula if you click on each cell. There is a native method - using some Excel driver (like XlsxWriter) available in Python. But if you are dealing with a big Excel sheet (or multiple sheets in one file), this approach becomes quite inconvenient. We present a new library called Portable Spreadsheet - it can easily export simply defined formulas in Python to many formats including Excel, JSON, etc.
