        This article is focused on the design and implementation details of the system for the prediction of renewable energy. I am talking here about the web application (not about the desktop app). Some helpful information from the project management perspective is also mentioned (including costs of the project). This article can be helpful for you to decide if you want to choose this path and to save your time.

        Library GDAL (developed by OSGeo) is more or less standard for the processing of geospatial data. Although it implements almost all the tools needed for this purposes, it is notoriously known for many operational problems. Mainly, it is practically impossible to install it quickly (as it requires many system-level dependencies), API is obsolete (designed in the late nineties) etc.

        One of the common challenges when dealing with big multidimensional data sets is how to store them. There are many problems to deal with, but arguably the most important one is what dimension order to choose. Although typically the selection of the optimal dimensional order does not have any impact on the size of the output file (if you use some compression situation may differ).

        A lot of things has been said in the past two decades about the possibilities of renewable energy. Many researchers probe the possibilities of power prediction in all horizons (short-term, mid-term and long-term). What is still an open question is what tools and datasets are now available for required computations. Especially what open-source tools are available.

        Famous library xarray is more or less standard in the data analyst branch. During the last few years, it has become incredibly popular. It has been deployed in many projects often without any careful decision if it is needed or if there is any other way how to treat the issue. One of the essential xarray functionality is the reading and writing to the NetCDF files. This is also a focus of this article.

        There are many common challenges related to systems that process large data sets (like big netCDF or GRIB files). One of the most important decision is whether to deploy infrastructure on some cloud service or if it is better to use an on-premises solution. If the cloud appeals to you then other challenges arise, which provider would be the best one, how to deploy - use infrastructure as a code.

        One of the common challenges in data processing is to provide quick access to constants (or map of constants) stored in tables. This structure is typically useful to store multidimensional look-up tables (LUT). One of the most user-friendly (or rather programmer-friendly) ways how to store multidimensional (generally 2D) objects in Python is to use Pandas library and DataFrames objects.
