        This article is focused on the design and implementation details of the system for the prediction of renewable energy. I am talking here about the web application (not about the desktop app). Some helpful information from the project management perspective is also mentioned (including costs of the project). This article can be helpful for you to decide if you want to choose this path and to save your time.

        Library GDAL (developed by OSGeo) is more or less standard for the processing of geospatial data. However, although it implements almost all the tools needed for this purpose, it is notoriously known for many operational problems. Mainly, it is practically impossible to install it quickly (as it requires many system-level dependencies), API is obsolete (designed in the late nineties).

        One of the common challenges when dealing with big multidimensional data sets is how to store them. There are many problems to deal with, but arguably the most important one is choosing dimension. Although typically, the selection of the optimal dimensional order does not impact the size of the output file (if you use some compression situation that may differ), it has a profound effect on the response time when accessing stored data.

        A lot of things has been said in the past two decades about the possibilities of renewable energy. Many researchers probe the possibilities of power prediction in all horizons (short-term, mid-term and long-term). What is still an open question is what tools and datasets are now available for required computations. Especially what open-source tools are available.

        Famous library xarray is more or less standard in the data analyst branch. During the last few years, it has become incredibly popular. It has been deployed in many projects often without any careful decision if it is needed or if there is any other way how to treat the issue. One of the essential xarray functionality is the reading and writing to the NetCDF files. This is also a focus of this article.

        There are many common challenges related to systems that process large data sets (like big netCDF or GRIB files). One of the most important decision is whether to deploy infrastructure on some cloud service or if it is better to use an on-premises solution. If the cloud appeals to you then other challenges arise, which provider would be the best one, how to deploy - use infrastructure as a code.

        In-memory database REDIS provides a simple interface for caching various data types. In addition, it supports simple manipulations with arrays and scalar values, including support for complex data constructs (like queues). What is, however not implemented, is the support of multi-dimensional objects. These objects are beneficial if you need to cache frequently used constants (or interim results) for computations (like matrices).
