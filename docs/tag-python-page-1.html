        Virtual environments are an incredibly helpful concept that makes your coding much easier. There are many tools in Python for creating and managing virtual environments. This article tends to analyze the native virtual environment (created using the venv command). Another simplified and more user-friendly approach is to use Anaconda software (using command conda).

        A lot of things has been said in the past two decades about the possibilities of renewable energy. Many researchers probe the possibilities of power prediction in all horizons (short-term, mid-term and long-term). What is still an open question is what tools and datasets are now available for required computations. Especially what open-source tools are available.

        One of the common challenges of on-demand large datasets processing is the time required for data processing. The naive approach is to compute the operations on the same unit that serves results (and horizontally scale the system when it is overloaded). The more complex (and generally speaking the only right) approach is to use some asynchronous task queue based on distributed message passing (message broker).

        Code profiling is one of the most important parts of the code optimisation process. Generally speaking, it is the program analysis where we are mainly interested in memory usage and time complexity of the program (or each of its part). We can also be interested in how often we use some function (or how often we call it, what's the duration). There are a lot of principles and tools to perform these tasks.

        Famous library xarray is more or less standard in the data analyst branch. During the last few years, it has become incredibly popular. It has been deployed in many projects often without any careful decision if it is needed or if there is any other way how to treat the issue. One of the essential xarray functionality is the reading and writing to the NetCDF files. This is also a focus of this article.

        There are many common challenges related to systems that process large data sets (like big netCDF or GRIB files). One of the most important decision is whether to deploy infrastructure on some cloud service or if it is better to use an on-premises solution. If the cloud appeals to you then other challenges arise, which provider would be the best one, how to deploy - use infrastructure as a code.
