        Library GDAL (developed by OSGeo) is more or less standard for the processing of geospatial data. Although it implements almost all the tools needed for this purposes, it is notoriously known for many operational problems. Mainly, it is practically impossible to install it quickly (as it requires many system-level dependencies), API is obsolete (designed in the late nineties) etc.

        One of the common challenges when dealing with big multidimensional data sets is how to store them. There are many problems to deal with, but arguably the most important one is what dimension order to choose. Although typically the selection of the optimal dimensional order does not have any impact on the size of the output file (if you use some compression situation may differ).

        A lot of things has been said in the past two decades about the possibilities of renewable energy. Many researchers probe the possibilities of power prediction in all horizons (short-term, mid-term and long-term). What is still an open question is what tools and datasets are now available for required computations. Especially what open-source tools are available.

        One of the common challenges of on-demand large datasets processing is the time required for data processing. The naive approach is to compute the operations on the same unit that serves results (and horizontally scale the system when it is overloaded). The more complex (and generally speaking the only right) approach is to use some asynchronous task queue based on distributed message passing (message broker).

        Famous library xarray is more or less standard in the data analyst branch. During the last few years, it has become incredibly popular. It has been deployed in many projects often without any careful decision if it is needed or if there is any other way how to treat the issue. One of the essential xarray functionality is the reading and writing to the NetCDF files. This is also a focus of this article.

        One of the common challenges in data processing is to provide quick access to constants (or map of constants) stored in tables. This structure is typically useful to store multidimensional look-up tables (LUT). One of the most user-friendly (or rather programmer-friendly) ways how to store multidimensional (generally 2D) objects in Python is to use Pandas library and DataFrames objects.
